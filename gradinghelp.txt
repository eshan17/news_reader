	-We used bootstrap for one thing. The icon inside the button is from Bootstrap. This is simply a custom icon class that Bootstrap provides that is in our HTML. 


4. CSS (including a reasonably range of techniques, such as reset, pseudo-selectors, fixed and fluid layout, transitions and animations, etc)

	-Our css comprises of regular css class selectors, css div selectors, using a body selector, custom font, we used the overflow feature, psuedo-class, used a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active, used paddings, margins. We also used position, float, text-align, display, font-size, and z-index. We used a fixed-layout for the site because NYTimes did so.
