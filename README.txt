We have been working to get this working on Chrome. Please use that as the main browser for grading.

LOGO:
We have used a canvas library (oCanvas) to display our competence in canvas manipulation by animating a square.
Please CLICK! to see it animate.

THE REAL STUFF:

	The idea
	------------
	To show the news article side-by-side with a wiki-page with one-click wiki-lookups.

	The project
	------------
	We used the NYTimes API to get the news articles and the wiki media API to get the wikis.
	So the way this works is that users can search for content or pick one of the preset links to get news.
	They can hit "More" to get the whole article.
	Once the whole article shows up, users can select text and hit 'Enter' to get the wiki page about the selected text.
	Once they are done reading, the can hit the 'Esc' key to go back to the headlines.

Goals not completed:
-------------------------------------------
Our initial idea was a little too ambitious given the amount of time we should have worked on it, so we didn't add as much functionality as we thought we could.
Some of the functionality we didn't add were:

1. We weren't able to add more functionality as we had planned earlier (like Dictionary, Stocks, etc.). However that would have been merely more API calls.
2. The logo is pretty lame, but none of us are designers really :(. So we just made an animation of a square.
3. Lots of scrollbars (sorry about that). Though it's pretty cool that if you use a Mac, you won't even realize that.
4. We haven't used fluid layouts. However, a lot of news companies (especially NYTimes), uses fixed layout.
