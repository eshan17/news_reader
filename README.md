This was the fourth assignment and a small project in a brand new class called Cross-Platform Mobile Web Apps (15-237) at Carnegie Mellon.  We had to create an a client-side app using javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. This app uses the NYTimes API to get articles, and when an article is clicked on you can open up a Wikipedia article in the same tab by highlighting a word and pressing enter. 
Everything was written in Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery.
